A very basic black jack card game made with Javascript, HTML &amp; CSS.

## Screenshots
### How it looks
There are two buttons, "start game" and "new card". Start game button starts the game and gives the player two random cards from 1 to 11 and the New card button gives the player a new card until they either win or lose. In order to win the game the person playing needs to get exactly 21, if they get more than that, they're out.


In this screenshot it shows how the game looks before it started.
